# sockets-storyboard

## Features

- Multiple clients collaborate on the same storyboard.
- Upload figures by drag and dropping or traditional file upload. Only PNG, JPEG and GIF formats supported.
- Delete a figure by mousing over it and clicking on the trash icon.
- Status bar in top right displays the number of active sockets.
- Status bar in top right displays activity such as user typing.

## How it Works

On the client-side vanilla JavaScript is used for interactions and DOM manipulation - no dependencies. Communication between the client-side and server-side is handled using Websockets (socket.io). On the server-side ExpressJS is used as a minimal web application framework (scaffolding, routing and file uploads). File uploads are handled using AJAX.

To address the data persistence needs, LokiJS is used for its fast, in-memory document-oriented database. LokiJS synchs from the in-memory storage to a local JSON file.
